                <p>Envirolab works on a variety of environmental, ecological, and conservation-
                    related issues and collaborates with numerous organizations worldwide across terrestrial,
                    coastal, and marine ecosystems as well as across spatial scales, from regional (East Africa) to
                    global, in order to help address pressing environmental issues, ecological, sustainability, and
                    conservation challenges across the globe. You can check out our activities here to see which suits
                    suits your needs and you call us?
